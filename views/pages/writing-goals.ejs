        From life changes to learning code – here’s my personal story and what brought me into coding.

  <!-- Main Story -->
   
  <section class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6 py-12 leading-relaxed">
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
 My goal is to become a professional developer and work at a tech company where I can keep growing, building, and contributing to real-world projects. I want to deepen my skills in JavaScript, Node.js, and backend development, and eventually learn full-stack development. Beyond getting a job, I hope to build tools that help others — especially self-taught learners like me. In the long term, I want to give back to the developer community and help others who are starting from scratch, just like I did.
