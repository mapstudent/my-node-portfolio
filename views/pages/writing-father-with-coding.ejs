  <!-- Main Story -->
   
  <section class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6 py-12 leading-relaxed">
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
  I’m also a father. I have a young son, and taking care of him is one of the most meaningful responsibilities in my life. Balancing parenting with learning to code hasn’t been easy — there are long nights, early mornings, and moments when I feel exhausted. But I keep going because I want to build a better future for both of us. Becoming a developer isn't just a dream — it’s a decision to commit to a career that demands focus, patience, and continuous learning. I’m not just doing this for myself, but for my family and the life we’re building together.
